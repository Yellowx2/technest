## Development
1. Base project created through Spring Initializr Web.
Changed properties file to YML type. Added in-memory H2 database configuration.
2. Created basic MVC project structure with its classes: Model, Controller, Repository and Service.
Model has the constraints required plus an Id to easily select it through a REST call.
Service has an interface and its respective implementation with a simple method for now.
